# Story 1.2: Basic UI Shell and Chart Viewer

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** User,
**I want** a basic application shell with a placeholder area for the org chart,
**so that** I can see where the generated chart will be displayed.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The main application page renders with a simple header and a primary content area.
2. The content area contains a placeholder element for the future chart.
3. An "Import Data" button is visible and clickable on the page.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 completion:
- Monorepo structure is established with `apps/web`, `apps/api`, and `packages/` directories
- Next.js frontend is configured with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/ui
- Basic "Hello World" page exists and can be extended
- Development environment is fully operational with testing framework in place

### Tech Stack and Framework Configuration
[Source: architecture/02-2-high-level-architecture.md#tech-stack]
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.4.5 for type safety
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.3 full-stack framework
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui (latest) with Tailwind CSS 3.4.3
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.3 for utility-first CSS
- **Testing**: Vitest 1.6.0 for unit/integration tests, Playwright 1.44.1 for E2E

### Project Structure Requirements

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/02-2-high-level-architecture.md#components]
Key components for this story:
- **Web UI (Frontend)**: Renders the UI and handles user interaction
- UI components should be created in `packages/ui` for reusability unless page-specific

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/02-2-high-level-architecture.md#coding-standards]
- **Type Sharing**: All shared types MUST be defined in `packages/shared`
- **Component Scoping**: UI components created in `packages/ui` unless page-specific
- **Naming Conventions**: 
  - Components: PascalCase (e.g., `ChartViewer.tsx`)
  - Files/Folders: kebab-case (e.g., `chart-viewer/`)
- **Environment Variables**: Must be accessed through centralized configuration module

### UI/UX Requirements
Based on story requirements:
- Simple, clean header design
- Clear content area for future chart display
- Prominent "Import Data" button with good accessibility
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- Consistent with Shadcn/ui design patterns

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- Main page: `apps/web/src/pages/index.tsx`
- Reusable components: `packages/ui/`
- Shared types: `packages/shared/`
- Styling: Tailwind CSS classes, global styles in `apps/web/src/styles/globals.css`

### Technical Constraints
- Must use Next.js 14.2.3 pages router structure
- TypeScript must be configured consistently
- Follow Shadcn/ui component patterns
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Ensure responsive design principles

## Testing
Test file location: Co-located with source files using `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` extensions
Test standards: Use Vitest for unit/integration tests, Playwright for E2E
Testing frameworks: Vitest 1.6.0, Playwright 1.44.1
Specific testing requirements: 
- Test component rendering and basic interaction
- Verify responsive layout behavior
- Test button click functionality
- Ensure accessibility standards are met

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-17
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
Overall implementation quality is **excellent**. The UI components are well-structured with proper TypeScript interfaces, clean separation of concerns, and follow React best practices. The component architecture is solid with reusable components properly placed in the `packages/ui` directory. The main page implementation is clean and responsive with proper Tailwind CSS usage.

### Refactoring Performed
No refactoring was required. The implementation was already well-structured and followed best practices.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ All components follow PascalCase naming, proper TypeScript interfaces, and consistent file structure
- Project Structure: ✓ UI components correctly placed in `packages/ui`, main page in `apps/web/src/pages/index.tsx`
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage with 19 total tests (11 UI component tests, 6 main page tests, 2 API tests)
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Improvements Checklist
[All items already handled in current implementation]

- [x] Header component with proper semantic HTML and accessibility (packages/ui/index.tsx)
- [x] Chart viewer placeholder with clear visual indicators (packages/ui/index.tsx)
- [x] Import Data button with proper click handling (packages/ui/index.tsx)
- [x] Responsive layout with proper Tailwind CSS classes (apps/web/src/pages/index.tsx)
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage for all components and interactions
- [x] Proper TypeScript interfaces and type safety throughout

### Security Review
No security concerns identified. No sensitive data handling in this UI-focused story. All components are safe for rendering and user interaction.

### Performance Considerations
- Bundle size remains optimal: ~81kB First Load JS (minimal increase from previous story)
- Components are properly structured for tree-shaking
- No unnecessary re-renders or performance bottlenecks
- SVG icons are inlined efficiently

### Accessibility Assessment
- Header uses proper semantic HTML with `<header>` and `<h1>` tags
- Button component has proper `button` element with click handling
- Visual hierarchy is clear with proper contrast ratios
- Components support keyboard navigation and screen readers
- Missing: ARIA labels could be enhanced for better accessibility

### Minor Enhancement Opportunities
- ESLint configuration needs setup for consistent code style (not blocking)
- Could add ARIA labels to ChartViewerPlaceholder for better screen reader support
- Consider adding loading states for future dynamic content

### Final Status
✓ **Approved - Ready for Done** - All acceptance criteria met, excellent component architecture, comprehensive testing, and clean implementation.
