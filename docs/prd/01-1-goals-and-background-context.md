# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

* To create a powerful, intuitive tool that simplifies the creation and maintenance of organizational charts.
* To deliver a focused MVP centered on efficient data import (`Intelligent Import`).
* To provide a seamless editing experience (`Visual Drag-and-Drop Editor`).
* To leverage AI for fast updates (`AI Command-Based Updates`).

## Background Context

This project aims to address the common pain points associated with organizational chart management. Traditional tools often require tedious manual data entry and are difficult to keep up-to-date. By leveraging AI for data input and providing a modern, intuitive editor, the AI-powered Organization Chart Generator will save HR professionals and managers significant time and effort, while providing a valuable, living resource for the entire organization.
