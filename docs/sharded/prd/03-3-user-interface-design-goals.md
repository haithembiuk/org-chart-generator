### **3. User Interface Design Goals**

#### **Overall UX Vision**

The vision is a clean, minimalist, and highly intuitive interface that empowers users to create and manage charts effortlessly. The primary goal is to reduce complexity and make the entire process feel fluid and responsive, turning a typically tedious task into a quick and pleasant one.

#### **Key Interaction Paradigms**

The core interactions will be file-based (a simple import process) and direct manipulation (drag-and-drop editing), supplemented by conversational AI commands for quick, power-user updates.

#### **Core Screens and Views**

For the MVP, we will need to design the following core areas:

* **Dashboard / Chart View**: The main interface where the generated organizational chart is displayed and interacted with.
* **Import Modal**: A simple, focused pop-up or screen for handling the file upload process.
* **Edit/Command Panel**: A dedicated area of the interface for managing drag-and-drop actions and entering AI text commands.

#### **Accessibility**

* **WCAG AA**: The application will be designed to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance standards, ensuring it is usable by people with a wide range of disabilities.

#### **Branding**

* No specific branding has been defined at this stage. A clean, professional default theme will be used.

#### **Target Device and Platforms**

* **Web Responsive**: The application will be designed primarily for desktop use but will be fully responsive to work on tablets and mobile devices for viewing purposes.
